		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			This blog makes no sense.  It is complete jibberish.  This is the first page I am linking to a navbar ever.  At some point, maybe I will change the entries to actual blog entries and create my own blog from this.  Basically, do not pay attention to the content of this blog as it is not an exercise in writing, but only in coding.  Thank you, enjoy my work!
