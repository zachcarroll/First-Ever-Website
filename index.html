				<h3>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						Hello all and welcome to my website!  I'm really proud of this creation and excited to continue to use it as a place to express myself, and experiment with front-end development.
					</p>
					<p>
						First off, one of my favorite things to do is to meet new people, so feel free to reach out!
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently, I'm a Product & Design Student at Startup Institute, a two-month long, full-time career accelerator.  While here I am working on technical front-end developer skills including HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery, as well as tons of other relevant skills, and getting a solid foundation of what is going on in the NYC tech industry.
					<p>
						I've also been taking advantage of the nice weather and seeing a bunch of live music as well as going hiking as much as I can on day trips outside of NYC.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before Startup Institute, I spent two years working at Nomura, a Japanese Investment Bank, working in a strategic role in the Risk Management Division.  
					</p>
					<p>
						During my time there I developed some serious PowerPoint and Excel skills, and did a bunch of projects on regulatory stuff and various other strategic initiatives.  I also traveled to Thailand, Peru, Utah and Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
					</p>
					<p>
						From 2007 to 2011, I studied Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University.  While there, I played club soccer, acted in a Spanish play, taught a class to inmates at a maximum security prison, began running regularly, and made some of my closest friends in the world.
