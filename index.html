				<h3>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						I'm 24 years young.  I have three sisters.  I currently live in NYC.  I went to Cornell University and graduated with a major in Applied Economics and Management (read: business major).  After graduation, I moved to NYC and promptly started a job in finance.  Fast forward two years and I am actively transitioning into the tech startup industry.  I'm now at The Startup Institute, a career accelerator, which is focused around preparing me for life at a tech startup.  Specifically, I am interested in pursuing a job as a front-end developer/designer, and combining the skills necessary to succeed in a position like that, with my business/finance/strategy skill set from university and working in finance.
					</p>
					<p>
						Beyond my career interests, I am an avid traveler, having been to 20+ countries.  I love photography, I will be setting up a photography site to house my work soon!  I also have a strong passion for the outdoors, anyone interested in going hiking now that the weather is nice?
					</p>
					<p>
						Disclaimer:  As I figure out what I want to do with this site, it will slowly morph into something with a little more substance.
